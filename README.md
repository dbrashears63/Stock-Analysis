# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
There were two purposes for this project. The first was to help “Steve” determine which stocks would be a good investment for his parent’s based on the data set we were given. The second purpose was to refactor the original code to see if the changes made any improvement in how fast the code ran.

### The Data
The data that was used was for the years 2017 and 2018. There was a sample set of 12 different stocks which included their starting price and ending price and total volume for day of trade. From this data we created code to determine the total daily volume and rate for return for each year. 

## Results

### Analysis

#### Stock Investment Results
Originally “Steve’s” parents wanted to invest all their money into DQ a green energy company. Being in finance Steve wanted to run an analysis of the DQ stock to see if it would be a good investment. When the data showed it showed a loss, Steve wanted “us” to preform an analysis of which stocks would be a good investment based on the data we had. Although 11 of the 12 stocks showed positive returns in 2017, over all between both years of data only the tickers of ENPH and RUN both had positive returns.
